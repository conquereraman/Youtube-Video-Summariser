this is a video I'm making for Avantethe young man who was working two jobswith a one-year-old who's struggling andsaid he was sick and tired of being poorand didn't know how to get out I didn'thave time to answer you when I waswalking but I wanted to take this minuteto give you a longer answer I'll readyou the Tweet maybe we'll put it up onthe screen to ivonte the young man whostopped me at the grocery store workingtwo jobs with one-year-old who askedadvice on how to get ahead I gave you ashort answer because I was in a rush andit ate at me so if you follow me heremaybe you'll read this what you're goingthrough is tough being so young andalready having to support a child is noteasy but you'll have the opportunity tobecome an amazing inspiration in a way Inever could your success story willbecome your sermon that being said underthe advice you're going to need toassume that luck isn't real or that itapplies to everyone else but you becausethe only way you're going to get out ofyour surroundings is by having somethingof value that other people want andright now the only thing you have isyour time with low skills to trade whichis a hard game to play you have to tradea lot of it only to get a little so yourmain objective is to have the time tolearn a skill while providing for yourfamily that means in the short term yourfamily may have to suffer scratch thatyour family will suffer but better nowwhen they're 2 young to remember thanwhen they're too old to forget again notforever but for now so these are thethings you're going to have to do andthis isn't dabble stuff this is wake the up because if you don't you'regonna blink and be 30 and in the samespot but worse number one cut all costsand I mean all costs you don't need outanymore for anything and if you'rehungry you deal with it if it's not froma discount grocery store you don't buyit clothing ha what you've got iseverything you need for the next twoyears period no exceptions reuse tradeor go to Goodwill you go to work you gohome and home is ideally with yourfamily and when I say family your folksand if you don't have folks who have gotwho've got room or a couch or a basementthat you can say at the worst case iswith another family also trying to makeit and save so it's six of you eight ofyou 10 of you in one spot all splittingit all of you contributing and it'sgonna be as cheap as you possibly cannumber two increase your income you'reworking two jobs your free time I wantyou to spend applying to other jobscloser to what you want to do he said hedidn't like either of the things that hewas doing at that time so any at homephone sales job has starter roles thatrequire zero experience to pay 40 000 ayear or more or do that and work yourother job in between if you can't driveUber if you don't have a car save upuntil you do number three the easiestthing to sell is someone else's stuff sostart there then learn how to buy stufffor cheap and then flip it the biggerthe thing the more you make you go fromflipping cards to Furniture to home andthe limit never really stops from thereon Final note I could hear the stress inyour voice when you were talking to meabout your situation it sounded like youdidn't know what to do sadness comesfrom a lack of options it's a feeling ofhopelessness but whenever you feel thatI want you to think this is ignorancenot sadness it means I don't know enoughand that I can control you asked me tocome work for free but I have no needfor low-skilled labor but I do have aneed for high skilled beasts it's why Imake the books and the courses and thecontent everywhere for free so use thosethen get yourself a high paying job andevery day apply for higher paying ones Irecommend sales to start then once youget in there for the love of God workuntil your fingers bleed because youhave no other option you have no lucknothing is going to work out for youyou're not going to catch a break you'regoing to have to make it happen you'regoing to have to force it you've got tobecome undeniable and the best news isis that you can do that in less than ayear so that's my advice number one cutall your costs everything number twowork more to make more and apply tobetter jobs and then learn to sell threestart selling more expensive stuff andthen eventually sell your own the gameis Just trading up over and over andover again you're just a few trades awayfrom a very different financialsituation so Avante I wanted to add ontop of that you're in a tough spot and Ithink some of the words I probably justsaid to you might hopefully hit homesomewhere but one of the hard thingsthat you've got going on right now islike when I saw you you were wearingrelatively nice clothes and I wasn'tgonna like bash you on it when I saw youbut I want to take the opportunity tosay like you know better you know what Imean like you know that like if you'restruggling with money that's the lastthing that you should spend money onright and um I think one of thedifficulties especially when you'reyounger is you've got your friends yougot your family and especially ifthey're all poor then they have terribleviews around money they might notapprove of all the stuff you're learningon the internet and trying to try thesenew things out and the real real is likeyou're gonna fail a lot and and they'regoing to see say she told you so and thetough part is is they're going to beright most of the time except it's oneof those things where it's 99 right but100 wrong is that anybody who betsagainst you for this thing being thething is usually going to be right it'sjust like a parent who says you're gonnabreak up with this person you're gonnabreak up with this person you're gonnabreak up with this person but they'reright with every single person you everdate except for the person you marry andthen they're 100 wrong and if you havethe perspective of listing to that itcan be incredibly disheartening and sonumber one is I want you to go on a on adifferent information diet so you needto be able to ignore all the stuff thatthey're giving you because like the bestway to stay poor is to listen to poorpeople about how to get rich you'realready taking great steps by likewashing content and doing stuff justkeep doing more of that and I'm sureyou're growing you know you have yourbaby with that's your world like anybodywho does it who's not trying to buildAvante 2.0 with you doesn't deserve yourtime because like right now you have awallet of money and you got a wallet ofminutes and like every single personyou're choosing to pay minutes to or paydollars to has to earn their keep andearning their keep in this season ofyour life is them helping you get towhere you want to go now I don't knowwhat you're making in your job I'm justgoing to assume the extreme scenario ifyou're making a minimum wage at bothjobs and you're working 80 hours doingthat I get it and I respect the hustlewhich is why I'm making this video youneed to get more for your time and rightnow the extra time on top of that 80 isyou sleeping and probably spending timewith your kid and what I'm going to saypeople in your surroundings will saylike that guy's extreme or that guy he'she's not balanced and the answer is yesI am extreme and I am unbalanced for theseason that you're in I think you shouldbe too because the thing is it's like ifyou don't take action on this five yearsis going to go by and nothing's going tochange because you're not going to getahead like you need to get your headfirmly above water because you probablybarely feel like you can keep your headabove surface right that's where allthat stress is coming from and you don'tknow what to do so to get the waterlower you've got to lower your timebudget and your money budget and I wantto go really extreme with you and I'mnot telling you to do anything I didn'tdo all right I owned my car in cashwhich I think was a five or six thousanddollar car and I slept in a room withanother dude in a house that had sixother people in it and we all split itso I wasn't in a terrible neighborhood Ijust paid 400 a month in a niceneighborhood because I didn't have myown place and so I had to split mykitchen and I had to deal with the factthat three of them had dogs and would and piss everywhere all the time itsucked but you know it would have suckedmore not being able to have the money tobuy the courses and the seminars and theworkshops that I was able to attend withthe extra that I saved so I could learnmy next skills and so right now food andshelter is the only thing you spendmoney on and you're gonna dropeverything else and you're gonna dropthose expenses to the greatest degreepossible and either your girl is workingif she's working then you can have childcare if she's not working to take careof the kid then you need to say listensweetie like I got to do this for usright now and so like you're puttingyour sacrifice in which is you'resacrifice in your career so we can youcan be with the kid I need to sacrificethe kid right now so I can have thecareer so that together as a familywe're balanced rather than theindividual so there's two levels ofbalance I want you to think about one isthe macro which is like you can bebounced over your lifespan when you'reretired you'll have more time you can goto Europe you can do whatever the otherstuff is right and also you can bebalanced in a family unit your wifemight spend more time with the kid thanshe does in her career but you're gonnaspend more time anything to do with thekit for now cut out the people who aretaking your time easy way to see this islike if the people in your life don'thave bigger dreams for you than you doignore all of their advice let's justignore them entirely and I know thatthat's simple to say and hard to do butyou're in a hard situation and I thinkthe question is whether you can beharder than your circumstances rightthere and you have to be to get out ofthis luck has already dealt you ahand let's assume he's never going togive you the right hand you're nevergoing to get lucky but you still need towin and so now it's like how do I dothat if you have a car you can have moreflexible hours if you drive throughthere that's something that I recommendfor a lot of people if you don't have acar you need to save up as fast as youcan to get one buy one in cash negotiatetry and get yourself five to tenthousand dollar car in cash you don'thave payments you just have theinsurance which because it's a cheap carwill be less the remainder of your timeand you got to tell your lady this it'slike I'm gonna be spending four hours aday every day watching these videos andthis isn't me Doom scrolling on YouTubeI need you to pick one skill that youwant to have and only consume stuffabout that this is my one thing I'll letyou buy it's a timer you can buy forfive bucks not your phone and you setthe timer set it for those four hours aday and every time you look away youstop the timer you do four hours of realwork of studying the skill after you'vedone enough of that work and you're likewhat's enough 20 hours like you're likeoh I could do that soon yeah I know soI'm telling you you can get out of thisfast you can switch those four hours ofyou learning the basics of that skilljust spending the rest of your timebeing the most amazing applicant to newjobs that exists in the world I didn'tsay go apply to jobs I said be the bestcandidate that has ever applied andyou're like I don't have experience andyou can address that like what I don'thave an experience I will make up forand hustle and you prove that bymessaging multiple people at everycompany with a snippet personalized toeach of them you know what other peopledo like they take a half step they copyand paste the same thing to all fourpeople and you know what the poor peopledo yeah yeah he copy and pasted the samemessage to me don't do that be personallook at the HR recruiter look at thehead of talent look at director ofwhatever and message each of them onLinkedIn if you don't have a LinkedIn goget one it's free and when you submityour resume put a personalized coverletter on it after reading from thewebsite what that business is about whenyou read the job description good jobdescription say what they want theperson to do and say like I will be ableto help do this thing because of thesethings right and especially a lowerlevel role your resume is not going tomatter as much don't let anybody aroundyou say that or fool you into that whatwill matter especially for low-levelroles is hustle so every employer wantsto see if somebody's going to go out oftheir way to go above and beyond and soyou demonstrate that you're gonna goabove and beyond and guess what's gonnahappen you're going to do this for fivedifferent places you're gonna write acustom thing it's gonna take you fourhours to do the research write thecustom thing message 20 people becauseit's going to be four people at all fiveplaces you know what's gonna happennothing because you're not lucky so whatare you gonna have to do gotta beundeniable do you think if you appliedto a thousand places like that over thenext six months you wouldn't get a job Ithink you would you think if like afteryou got off your shift and you droveover and you said hey I just want to letyou know not in a creepy way and say heyjust let you know I applied to put myresume I messaged a couple you guys Ijust want to let you know I'm reallyexcited about the opportunity don't wantto be overbearing but if you guys wouldgive me a shot I promise I'll wear partof any other candidate here and I'd liketo show you that I'm demonstrating thatby these things you're like I have proofthat I'm saying I'm not just making thisup proof that I will work harder and youknow what will happen one of them sayI'll give you a shot and then when theygive you that shot shove it ineveryone's face how hard you work not bywhat you say but by what you do besilent and just kill look at what thetop guy does and do twice as much asthat guy does be Kobe for whatever thejob is if you don't know the whole storyabout Kobe he did three practices a daywhile everyone else did one or twobecause he wanted to get ahead and inthe beginning he was worse than them andthen he got as good as them and then hebecame better than them and he keptdoing three practices a day untileventually no one could catch up becauseif they were doing three practices a daythey would just keep up with his rate ofprogress but he got ahead and so the guywho's number one at whatever thatbusiness is probably works better thanyou and he works longer than you and soyou can't just match him to get aheadbecause he'll always be ahead you gottamatch his current effort and then doyour I'm gonna get ahead of you effortlike when he clocks out is when yourwork clocks in that's when Avante 2.0clocks in and the thing is it's like ifyou can adopt this like if you canreally internalize this you're gonnaCrush you're going to win you can makeluck not a factor when I had Jacob my 19year old my son son I'm kidding when Iwas talking to him I think he was 16actually 6 15 or 16 when I startedtalking about this imagine he's evenless reason to get a job than you allright less experience I gave him threewords and he said he still remembers himthis day I said volume negates luck ifyou need to put it put on the back ofyour phones as a reminder to yourselfbecause in the beginning the volumeyou're gonna do is the timer of youwatching the videos and taking the notesand watching the videos learning thelingo learning the language so that whenyou get into an interview you know whatto say and then reps is going to bewatching mock interviews on YouTubewatching people who are hiring expertstalk about the best ways to presentwatch some of Layla's videos about howto interview correctly you do that stuffyou'll put yourself ahead of otherpeople volume okay cool now you're likeokay but I'm not getting interviewsvolume negates up crank the timer startdoing the Reps one a day two a day threea day four day five a day six a day 10 aday every single day you're like waitthat's 40 messages that are personalizedand 10 cover letters yeah that'llprobably take about four hours and thenwhat do you do tomorrow set the timeryou do it again next day set the timeryou do it again what do you do the nextday set the timer you do it agame and you keep doing yeah and on theones that you really really like youdrive over there after you get off yourshift you stop by and you say hey I'mAvante I'm really excited about theopportunity I think I could help Iapplied you got a couple message from meI promise I'm not a weirdo I just did itbecause I wanted to stick out for therest of the pile because I know you guysI'm sure for an opportunity as good asthis you probably got a lot of peoplewho are interested I just promise youthat I just want a shot you say thatthey will give you the interview and ifthey don'tsomeone will and once you do get thatjob and you work harder than everyoneelseyou turn the dial and you don't do itfor a week you don't work harder thaneveryone else for a week you don't workhard at them for a month you don't workharder than for six months you workharder than the top guy for a year fortwo years you're like well dude I'malready like two or three years from nowyeah I said it was a season but on theother side of this season is everythingelse that you want and so if I saidDevonte in 36 months are you willing togive me 36 months to get yourself out ofthe feeling that you have right nowyou're like I'm sick and tired of beingpoor I'm sick of not being able to buythe stuff for my girl that I want I'msick and I'll be able to provide for mykid I want him to be in a good zip codeI want to be able to have good school Iwant them to be able to have thesethings there's a price tag on them thequestion is just whether or not you'rewilling to pay it if you're willing topay itcrank the dial and volume will negatelocked but you can't rely on lock youcan rely on volume because that Ipromise you independent of race colorsocioeconomic background really waitsome racist socioeconomic backgroundsare how someone appears uh gives them anadvantage short but if you do it amillion times just give an advantagebecause you only need one yes if there'slike a lesson I can like have you likeetch into your brain is that there's asignificant amount of money andopportunity that sits on the other sideof being willing to be rejected by astranger if you get rejected a thousandtimes you are no worse off than you areright now in fact you're better whybecause you have a thousand timesexperience and so you either learn oryou win which means in both cases bydoing you win by default I'll give you alittle analogy so let's say you and yourbuddy are thinking about asking a girlto prom it'll make sense in a second andyour buddy's like ah man I want to askNicole and you're like all right man whydon't you go ask her it's like what ifshe says no he's like well then you'rein the exact same position you are nowwhich is you have no prom date you willalso have no prom date but you'll haveexperience of asking one wrong whathappens when you talk to the next Roadyou'll probably be a little less nervousand you probably realize that you'llsurvive you you will live if you hear ano and if you ask 100 girls do you thinkone of them will say yes to your promdate probably and in that situation whatare you now better off than you werebefore you asked the moral of the storythere is that you lose nothing from noyou only stand something to gain fromyeses and one yes can change your entirelife and so if you're willing to berejected and see the rejections as youlearning meaning you win and see theyeses as you also winning then you can'tmove and everybody else around you who'spoor is going to convince you otherwisethey're going to be like why are youstill doing this man stop botheringthose people man you're never going toget the job and you need to readjustyour expectations set your goals slowerhey that stuff's not for us rightthey're going to tell you those thingsbecause the thing is is that you havesomething that I do not have and thatmany people won't have is that you havea hard beginning you have aharder and bigger monster to slay butthe bigger the monster the more epic thehero and so these are the stories thatyou're going to someday tell and theseare gonna be the sermons that you'regoing to be able to give to otherAvantes in the future if you can't evenmuster the willingness to fail foryourself be willing to fail for your kidfor the story that you're to tell themand be willing to fail for the hundredother a thousand other Avantes thatyou'll be able to someday tell yourstory to so they can get out of theirsituation so I didn't have time to saythat but hopefully I'll give you acouple more minutes to give you a littlemore context I think I can speakconfidently for all imagination we'reall rude for you
